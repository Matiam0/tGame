# Synopsys

This started as a personal project to help with learning python. Now I'm mostly working on [src\tlib.py](https://github.com/ArttieF/TGame/blob/main/src/tlib.py) and it's functionality as a library. I'm trying to keep it to things that are text related and used frequently. I may rename it at some pointor extend the name. For now thogh as I find functions needed in working on [tgame.py](https://github.com/ArttieF/TGame/blob/main/tgame.py) i will add them to [src\tlib.py](https://github.com/ArttieF/TGame/blob/main/src/tlib.py).

# TLib
    Is a utility library focused on text based utils, and a few extras that I find used often.

# TGame
    Just a little text based RPG I'm working with for fun.
